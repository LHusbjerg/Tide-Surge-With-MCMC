This project determines the parameter values in a generalized pareto distribution using markov chain monte carlo simulations.

By esimating these parameters we can learn if our chosen predictor, the north atlantic oscillation index (NAO) has a meaningful impact on tide surges in stockholm.

For the results see graphs/returnp_with_pred.png which shows that the surges in stockholm is both more common and larger when NAO is high. Red dots indicate high NAO, blue low NAO

The idea is you sample a GPD with the data as arguments which allow you to estimate the parameters in said GPD

tide_surge.py is the main program which runs the MCMC

returnplort.py is for creating the returnplot.
